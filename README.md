# Crypto-Price-Movement-Prediction
This project predicts short-term price movements of the top 10 cryptocurrencies using historical OHLCV data. Machine learning models are applied to engineered price, volatility, momentum, and lag-based features to classify market direction (up/down). Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics and confusion matrices.
